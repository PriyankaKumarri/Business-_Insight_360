### Pre-Project Planning

It’s crucial to define the scope and expectations clearly before launching the project:

- What are the primary objectives for this Power BI dashboard?
- How will we measure the project’s success?
- What is the project deadline?
- Are stakeholders expecting a preview before the final release?
- What are stakeholders' main concerns and expectations for this dashboard?
- Who will use this dashboard and for what purposes?

### Data Understanding

A thorough understanding of the available data is essential:

- Dimension Table: Contains static data like customer and product details.
- Fact Table: Records transaction data.

## Importing Data into Power BI

Data for this project is sourced from a MySQL database. Proper credentials are required for importing data into Power BI.

## Data Modeling

Effective data modeling is foundational to report performance. Poor modeling can impact the overall effectiveness of the report. We employed a snowflake modeling technique for optimal results.

### Dashboard Design

Following initial mock-ups, the team designs interactive visuals and creates necessary measures.

## Report Views

- Home: Central navigation hub for all report views.
- Info: Detailed project information.
- Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, Executive: Dedicated views for specific insights.
- Products: Detailed product analysis.


## Project Outcome

This Power BI report is instrumental in facilitating data-backed decision-making, providing clarity for strategic planning, and addressing numerous situational queries.
